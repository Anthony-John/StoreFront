                     <h1>Responsive Design</h1>
                     <p>
                        Responsive design is a very simple concept. It simply means that whatever you are designing<br>
                        will adapt to its environment actively. This concept mainly applies to web design. Today,<br>
                        there is a vast array of devices and each of them come with there own dimensions, developers<br>
                        have to be able to make web applications that can adapt their appearance to these devices. <br>
                        When designing webpages there are many ways to incorporate responsive design into your code. <br>
                        Some of these options include using certain size units, frameworks, or templates. The two <br>
                        biggest concepts that govern responsive web design is layout, and size adjustment. Layout, <br>
                        in responsive design, involves changing the layout of a site’s content according to screen <br>
                        dimensions. To approach the problem of layout most developers like to apply grid structures <br>
                        to their web pages that store different objects. To maximize the effectiveness of girds <br>
                        dynamic sizing units, have to be used. Some units such as em, and percent are good to use when <br>
                         making responsive web pages because they are scalable and don’t have fixed sizes. In this project <br>
                         I used the framework Bootstrap to add responsive design to my webpages. In bootstrap there is two <br>
                         features that I used, cards and grids. Cards allow for a picture to be used with a text box in one <br>
                          object which is good for keeping things contained. I combined this with bootstrap’s grid feature <br>
                          so I could control the layout.
